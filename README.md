The address of the backend service to be called is configured via Spring properties.
The following properties define the addresses:
* ``service.address.auth`` - the address of the authentication service
* ``service.address.bill`` - the address of the billing service

The following command shows how to start service with all three backend services running on the same address:
```
java -jar target/api_gateway_reactive-1.0-SNAPSHOT-spring-boot.jar --service.address.auth=10.1.0.5:3000 --service.address.bill=10.1.0.5:3000 --service.address.delivery=10.1.0.5:3000
